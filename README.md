This little tool helps you to find queries on your transports. You can either start with a query and receive all transports or you start with a transport and receive all queries which are on the transport request. Or you have a query element and search for this specific element. The output is an ALV Grid.

Or you search with the query element uid to find the corresponding query

Or you insert a transport request to find out what behind the query element uids.
